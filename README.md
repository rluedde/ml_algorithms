# Algorithms

This repository contains matrix-based Python implementations of linear
regression and k-means clustering models. 

## Repository Structure

ml_algorithms (main directory)
- linear_regression.py - `class LinearModel`                
- k_means_clustering.py - `class KMeansClassifier`

## Future Work

* Add logistic regression, naive Bayes, or a decision tree of some sort
* Put on PyPi so this can be installied via `conda`? I'm doubt that's worth it because there's
libraries that do the same thing and probably much more efficiently.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! PR away if you find anything that should be changed!
